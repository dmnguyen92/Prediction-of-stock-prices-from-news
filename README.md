# Prediction-of-stock-prices-from-news
This code is my solution to Kaggle's competition: [Using News to Predict Stock Movements](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-news/overview). The goal is to predict future movement of stock's price based on two sets of data:
* Historical market data
* Financial news provided by Reuters. The available information are not the full news but its title, tags, length, urgency, sentiment, etc.

My solution, which focus on exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and emsembling tree-based model can be found [HERE](https://www.kaggle.com/dmdm02/complete-eda-voting-lightgbm)
